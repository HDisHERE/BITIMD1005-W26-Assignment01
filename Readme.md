## What's in the box?
This is a tiny protfolio website to show different projects he has, designed for his resume.

There is a landing page, a project library and one of the detailed project page.

## Steps

1. I designed most of the layout structure for all three pages including the navbar, titles and footer. 
2. I used Figma to generate the rough html structure at first, then add more content by myself. Also I used Figma&ChatGPT to create the complex box structures, like introduction and project card, then build more detailed structures inside the boxex by myself.
I have to say there are too many divs in my code. It's clear to use in css part, but hard to view in the html structure.
3. The color panel is generated by Chatgpt, but I made some changes for the fonts according to the feedback from my client.
